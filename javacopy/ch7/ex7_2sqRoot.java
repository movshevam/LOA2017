/*Exercise 7.2. Letâ€™s say you are given a number, a, and you want to find its
square root. One way to do that is to start with a very rough guess about the
answer, x0, and then improve the guess using the following formula:
x1 = (x0 + a/x0)/2
For example, if we want to find the square root of 9, and we start with x0 = 6,
then x1 = (6 + 9/6)/2 = 15/4 = 3.75, which is closer. We can repeat the
procedure, using x1 to calculate x2, and so on. In this case, x2 = 3.075 and
x3 = 3.00091. So that is converging very quickly on the right answer(which is 3).
Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double as a parameter and that
returns an approximation of the square root of the parameter, using this
technique. You may not use Math.sqrt. As your initial guess, you should use
a/2. Your method should iterate until it gets two consecutive estimates that
differ by less than 0.0001; in other words, until the absolute value of
xn-x(n-1) is less than 0.0001. You can use Math.abs to calculate the absolute
value.
