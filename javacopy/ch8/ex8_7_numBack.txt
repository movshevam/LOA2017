Exercise 8.7. A friend of yours shows you the following method and explains
that if number is any two-digit number, the program will output the number
backwards. He claims that if number is 17, the method will output 71.
Is he right? If not, explain what the program actually does and modify it so
that it does the right thing.
     int number = 17;                               //
     int lastDigit = number%10;                     //17%10 = 7
     int firstDigit = number/10;                    //17/10 = 1
     System.out.println(lastDigit + firstDigit);    //7+1 = 8

     This program actually computes the sum of the digits.
     The correct code would be:

     int number = 17;
     int lastDigit = number%10;
     int firstDigit = number/10;
     System.out.println(lastDigit + "" + firstDigit);
