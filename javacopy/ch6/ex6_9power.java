/*
Exercise 6.9. Write a recursive method called power that takes a double x
and an integer n and that returns xn.
Hint: a recursive definition of this operation is xn = xÂ·xn 1. Also, remember
that anything raised to the zeroeth power is 1.
Optional challenge: you can make this method more e cient, when n is even,
using x^n =  (x^n/2)^2.
