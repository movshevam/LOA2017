Exercise 12.7. Some programmers disagree with the general rule that variables
and methods should be given meaningful names. Instead, they think variables
and methods should be named after fruit.
For each of the following methods, write one sentence that describes abstractly
what the method does. For each variable, identify the role it plays.

/* Calculate the sum of all members of an array.
  @param a - array of integers
  @return sum of integers
*/
public static int banana(int[] a) {
    int grape = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < a.length) {
        grape = grape + a[i];
        i++;
    }
    return grape;
}
/* Find how many times an integer appears in an array.
  @param a - array of integers
  @param p - integer to be found
  @return number of times p appears in array.
*/
public static int apple(int[] a, int p) {
    int i = 0;
    int pear = 0;
    while (i < a.length) {
        if (a[i] == p) pear++;
        i++;
    }
    return pear;
}
/* Find index of first location of an integer in an array.
  @param a - array of integers
  @param p - integer to be found
  @return i - location of integer in array
          -1 if integer is not in array.
*/
public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int p) {
    for (int i = 0; i<a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] == p) return i;
    }
return -1;
}
The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading code and recognizing
the computation patterns we have seen.
